1Long time ago a man left the Earth.
1He was given a mission.
1This mission was to find life on another planet, another home.

--- 

2He was sent on this mission, because his home was dying.
2A catastrophe bound to doom his planet was impending.
2Though the people could only blame themselves.

--- 

3Far away, he found a planet.
3His communication devices, however, were broken.
3Thus, he was returning home to bring the news.

--- 

4The journey was rough.
4He wasn't alone when he left.
4But it was for a better cause, or so he wanted to think.

--- 

5On his way back, the man was running out of resources.
5Luckily, his water recycler was still running, and with only him left, food was... enough, at least.
5But fuel he didn't have enough.

--- 

6Something comparable to fuel was found on the planets of his system.
6However, even a tank of it only carried short distances.
6How much longer would his shuttle last, he often wondered.

--- 

7Finally, resources exhausted and his shuttle at its breaking point, the man reached Earth.
7He had returned home.
7To nothing.

---

8But then the man realised it.
8His real home had been his spaceship all along.
8He took off to the stars, in hopes of finding some new friends to share his home with.
