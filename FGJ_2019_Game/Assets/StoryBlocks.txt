Long time ago a man left the Earth.
He was given a mission.
This mission was to find life on another planet, another home.

--- 

He was sent on this mission, because his home was dying.
A catastrophe bound to doom his planet was impending.
Though the people could only blame themselves.

--- 

Far away, he found a planet.
His communication devices, however, were broken.
Thus, he was returning home to bring the news.

--- 

The journey was rough.
He wasn't alone when he left.
But it was for a better cause, or so he wanted to think.

--- 

On his way back, the man was running out of resources.
Luckily, his water recycler was still running, and with only him left, food was... enough, at least.
But fuel he didn't have enough.

--- 

Something comparable to fuel was found on the planets of his system.
However, even a tank of it only carried short distances.
How much longer would his shuttle last, he often wondered.

--- 

Finally, resources exhausted and his shuttle at its breaking point, the man reached Earth.
He had returned home.
To nothing.
